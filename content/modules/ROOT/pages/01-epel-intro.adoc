== Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)

In this lab, you will learn about
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/[Extra Packages for Enterprise
Linux (EPEL)], a repository of packages designed to increase the
flexibility of working with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. EPEL has been
curated such that none of the packages in EPEL should conflict with
anything that ships with RHEL, meaning that EPEL enables greater
flexibility for users while maximizing compatibility with RHEL.

NOTE: If you choose to use the RHEL web console at any point during
this lab, you can log in using the following credentials: - Username:
rhel - Password: redhat

Suppose that you wish to use BusyBox for system administration. In this lab, we will
install BusyBox, but you can install any package from EPEL with the same
steps by changing the name of the package in your `+dnf install+`
command.

First, letâ€™s try to install BusyBox without enabling EPEL. To do this, run
the following command:

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install -y busybox
----

The installation will not be successful because your package manager
(dnf) does not have access to a repository containing BusyBox. As such,
you will see an output that resembles this:

.BusyBox installation output

We can fix this problem by enabling EPEL with the following command:

[source,bash,run]
----
subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-10-$(arch)-rpms
dnf install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-10.noarch.rpm
----

The output will look like this:

.EPEL installation output
