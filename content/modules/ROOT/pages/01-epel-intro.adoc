In this lab, you will learn about
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/[Extra Packages for Enterprise
Linux (EPEL)], a repository of packages designed to increase the
flexibility of working with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. EPEL has been
curated such that none of the packages in EPEL should conflict with
anything that ships with RHEL, meaning that EPEL enables greater
flexibility for users while maximizing compatibility with RHEL.

Suppose that you wish to use Conda for programming. In this lab, we will
install Conda, but you can install any package from EPEL with the same
steps by changing the name of the package in your `+dnf install+`
command.

First, letâ€™s try to install Conda without enabling EPEL. To do this, run
the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dnf install -y conda
----

The installation will not be successful because your package manager
(dnf) does not have access to a repository containing Conda. As such,
you will see an output that resembles this:

We can fix this problem by enabling EPEL with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-$(arch)-rpms
dnf install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm
----

The output will look like this:

You have now successfully enabled Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux.
You can verify your installation by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dnf repolist
----

After running this command, you will be presented with a list of enabled
software repositories. One of the lines should contain `+epel+` or
`+Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 9 - x86-64+`.

Now that you have confirmed the EPEL installation, try installing Conda:

[source,bash]
----
dnf install -y conda
----

This time, the last line of output should say `+Complete!+` indicating
that you have successfully installed Conda.

To verify that Conda is installed and working properly, run this command
to view the version of Conda that is installed on your system

[source,bash]
----
conda -V
----

The output of this command should look like `+conda 4.14.0+`. The exact
number may change as new versions of Conda are released, but it will
remain in this format.
