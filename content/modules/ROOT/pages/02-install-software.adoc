= Install busybox

You have now successfully enabled Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux.
You can verify your installation by running the following command:

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf repolist
----

After running this command, you will be presented with a list of enabled
software repositories. One of the lines should contain `+epel+` or
`+Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 10 - x86-64+`.

Now that you have confirmed the EPEL installation, try installing busybox:

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install -y busybox
----

This time, the last line of output should say `+Complete!+` indicating
that you have successfully installed busybox.

To verify that busybox is installed and working properly, run this command
to view the version of busybox that is installed on your system

[source,bash,run]
----
busybox -V
----

The output of this command should look like `+busybox 4.14.0+`. The exact
number may change as new versions of busybox are released, but it will
remain in this format.
